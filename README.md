## About Me
Programming enthusiast  
Programming with AutoHotkey  
Learning Python  

I’m curious about most programming languages and learn them as needs arise.  

### Projects

#### AHKv2HTTP

An HTTP server for AutoHotkey v2 that depends on [Socket.ahk](https://github.com/thqby/ahk2_lib/blob/master/Socket.ahk).

Inspired by [AHKhttp](https://github.com/zhamlin/AHKhttp) and the need to fully migrate to AHK v2, I developed AHKv2HTTP.

#### AHK2_lib
My AHK v2 library, containing several commonly used functions.

- [Range.ahk](https://github.com/Summer1Solstice/AHK2_lib/blob/master/Range.ahk) A Python-style half-open sequence iterator (left-inclusive, right-exclusive), and also an AutoHotkey-style closed-interval iterator.
- [join.ahk](https://github.com/Summer1Solstice/AHK2_lib/blob/master/join.ahk) An AutoHotkey implementation of JavaScript’s `join` method.
- [Brainfuck.ahk](https://github.com/Summer1Solstice/AHK2_lib/blob/master/Brainfuck.ahk) An interpreter for the Brainfuck language.
